Computational Assignment 1 Overview

Estimating Euler's Number using Monte Carlo Simulation (40 points):

Part (a): Implement a serial code to estimate Euler's number using the Monte Carlo method, and run it on a single node with one core.
Part (b): Parallelize the code from Part (a) using mpi4py and execute it on a single node with two cores.
Part (c): Extend the parallel implementation to run on two nodes with two cores each.
Part (d): Analyze and compare the execution time and results across the different implementations.

Privacy-Preserving K-Means Clustering (60 points):

Part (a): Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm serially and run it on a single node with one core using a provided dataset.
Part (b): Parallelize the K-Means algorithm using mpi4py and execute it on a single node with two cores.
Part (c): Further extend the parallel implementation to run on two nodes with two cores each.
Part (d): Generate and analyze the final clustering results and execution time, comparing the different approaches.

Benchmarking Linear Algebra Operations in NumPy (15 points):

Implement and benchmark various linear algebra operations using NumPy, focusing on matrix multiplication, eigenvalue computation, and ordinary least squares regression.
Use profiling tools to measure memory usage and execution time for operations on different data sizes.
Compare the performance of different BLAS implementations.
